pls review my scalping program if it follow this prompt, 
if not pls correct it to follow this pompt


# TODO: Implement nested trend line detection - M1 lines within M5 boundaries
# Goal: Find M1 support/resistance lines that exist INSIDE M5 channel
# Process: Get M5 major lines, then find M1 pivot points within those boundaries
# Filter: Only M1 lines that are between M5 support and M5 resistance
# Output: Multiple M1 trading levels within single M5 channel
# Expected: 3-5 M1 trading zones within each M5 channel for scalping
def detect_nested_trend_lines(self, symbol):

# TODO: Create specific trading zones between adjacent M1 trend lines
# Logic: Sort all M1 support/resistance levels, create zones between adjacent levels
# Validate: Zones must have minimum width (5+ points) and be within M5 boundaries
# Purpose: Each zone becomes a scalping opportunity (buy bottom, sell top)
# Expected: Clear entry/exit levels for rapid M1 scalping
def create_m1_trading_zones(self, m5_structure, m1_nested_lines):

# TODO: Execute M1 scalping within nested zones respecting M5 boundaries
# Strategy: BUY at M1 support, SELL at M1 resistance, multiple times per M5 channel
# Safety: Never trade beyond M5 boundaries (ultimate stop levels)
# Precision: 1-2 point stops, 5-10 point targets, high frequency trading
# Expected: 10-20 scalp trades per day with 75%+ win rate
